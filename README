This is a hacked-up version of rsc's version of pico.

Changes:
- remove p9p shit and some bitrot
- use mk to build binary instead of hardcoding CC/LD
- arbitrary image sizes; set when loading or displaying an image; default
  248x248
- work on ABGR32 images; channels are accessed via a third 'z' coordinate
- add &&, || operators
- name nameless images as $1, $2,...
- images are always written once to /tmp prior to any processing
- fix numerous memory leaks
- accept integers in octal and hexadecimal, as well as doubles
- accept digits and utf in names
